    <string name="about_text">This battery app interacts directly with the chip inside the DS2784 battery.  Each
    parameter seen in this app is pulled from the corresponding register location inside
    the EEPROM memory.  This app allows both read and write to any of these registers
    giving the user full control over their battery\'s parameters.\n
    \nIn order for this app to function it must be used on a custom ROM with an edited
    ds2784_battery.c driver, which is most commonly available on Cyanogenmod 6.1 and
    pershoot\'s kernel for the Nexus One.\n
    \nThe driver edits to the Nexus battery driver are available thanks to:\n\ntheloginwithnoname @XDA
    and \nRogerPodacter @XDA.
